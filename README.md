# PanelPulse

A simple, efficient visualization tool that demonstrates the relationship between dust accumulation and solar panel efficiency, supporting the research on "Energy and Cost Efficient Self-Cleaning Solar Panels."

## Features

- **Dust vs Efficiency Correlation**: Interactive scatter plot showing the impact of dust on panel efficiency
- **Time Series Analysis**: Visualization of efficiency and dust levels over time
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Built with Plotly for rich, interactive data exploration

## Live Demo

View the interactive visualizations on our GitHub Pages site:
https://hamzapatel01.github.io/PanelPulse/

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the visualization script:
```
python simple_viz.py
```

This will generate interactive HTML visualizations in the `figures` directory that can be opened in any web browser.

## GitHub Pages Deployment

This project is set up for GitHub Pages deployment. The script automatically creates a `docs` directory with all necessary files. To deploy changes:

1. Run `python simple_viz.py` to generate visualizations
2. Commit and push changes to GitHub
3. GitHub Pages will automatically deploy from the `docs` folder

## Project Context

This visualization tool supports research on self-cleaning solar panels that use piezoelectric thin-film actuators for dust removal. The visualizations clearly demonstrate how dust accumulation affects panel efficiency and the potential benefits of implementing automated cleaning systems.
